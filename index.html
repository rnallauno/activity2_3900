                <h2>About me:</h2>

                <p>Hello, my name is Rakshith Nalla. I hold a Bachelor of Technology in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Manipal University Jaipur 
                    and am currently pursuing my Master's in Management Information Systems at the University of Nebraska Omaha in Omaha. 
                    I have professional experience as a Software Developer at Param Technologies, where I worked on software development, 
                    program enhancements, and system optimization. My background also includes hands-on experience with industrial automation, 
                    PLC programming, VFD integration, and SAP from my time at NSIC and Siemens Ltd.
                    Outside of academics and work, in my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, gaming (especially Valorant), watching movies and anime, 
                    cooking, and indulging in good food. I'm also fascinated by new technology and love learning about the latest innovations 
                    and participating in robotics and tech competitions.
